# Line of Best Fit

Lately, I have been studying machine learning and specifically looking at linear regression. In linear regression, part of the model-building procedure is to obtain the line of best fit of the correlation between the features and the labels.

I thought I'd build a simple program which reads data from a .csv file and calculates the equation of the line of best fit of the correlation of the data.

The data for this program has been obtained from [here](https://zeescorrelationstudy.weebly.com/).
